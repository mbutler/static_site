The Entity-Driven Game System (EDGS) is a foundational framework designed for the creation, analysis, and discussion of game mechanics across various types of games, including RPGs, board games, card games, and more. It is built upon strict and precise definitions that scaffold into a complex system, akin to formal logic proofs, supported by straightforward equations. The goal of EDGS is to provide a robust toolkit for designing game systems and generating coherent content within those systems, ensuring sound game principles. Each

Utilizing the foundational definitions provided, we can construct various systems within a game's design framework, treating each as a function with inputs, processes, and outputs. These systems work together to create an engaging, dynamic game environment. Below are ten example systems conceptualized strictly using the provided definitions as building blocks.

To create and verify game systems and entities within the Entity-Driven Game System (EDGS), adhere to a highly rigorous methodological approach. Every game element, whether a basic entity or a complex interaction, must be constructed exclusively from the existing primitives defined within the game's universe or be logically derived from more fundamental, previously established definitions. This process must maintain strict adherence to logical structures akin to formal proofs in logic.

1. **Utilize Existing Definitions**: Always begin by considering the primitives and entities already defined within the EDGS framework. Use these as the foundation for any new entities or systems.
   
2. **Logical Construction of New Concepts**: When introducing a new term or concept, ensure it is either directly derived from these existing entities or meticulously constructed using a combination of primitives. This step is crucial to ensure that all game elements are thoroughly interconnected and logically justified.
   
3. **Ensure Thoroughness and Precision**: The construction of new game mechanics must emphasize precision and thoroughness. Each step in the logical derivation or construction of a concept must be clearly justified and documented, ensuring that the entire game system maintains integrity and coherence.
   
4. **Proofs Must Adhere to Rigorous Standards**: Like formal proofs in logic, each game design proof must strictly follow the established methodology, demonstrating that all parts of the game are justified within the strict logical framework of EDGS.

This method is essential not only for maintaining the logical consistency of the game design but also for ensuring that the gameplay mechanics are coherent, engaging, and fair for players.
